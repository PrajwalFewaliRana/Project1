# Project1
This project was made by uinge vite + react with tailwind css.

This is my first project where i clonned the design of instagram and the function as well. I also made it responsive to all device but
not to the device greater than mine.
I tried my best to copy all the function of instagram and i do sucess but there are some function which i have not coded in this clone
app . They are like : comment section and to do comment,like and share add to favourites etc and also login etc.

There are also some bugs (only from 1263- 1326px width) like:
If you click to the search bar it opens search menu and hide the names and only shows icons and without closing the search bar if you
click to the message icon then the whole things will messed up, the functions will act oppositely . I tried but i couldn't solve that 
so i left it as it is .

I did't try to make all the functionality and make it work like exactly the real one  because if i do that then the whole team (who coded instagram)
will feel very low and i don't want to make them feel like that. (Just kidding)
